# CodeClippy

Our mission is to make it easy for developers to find and reuse code. CodeClippy
is an Atom plugin that aims to act as a gateway for enabling this vision.

Initially, CodeClippy's goal is to provide access to SolutionLoft's querying engine
of indexed StackOverflow questions and answers, allowing the user to interact with StackOverflow Q/A without leaving the comfort of his or her editor.

## Getting Started

This section will eventually be updated with instructions for using CodeClippy.
After initial alpha test, CodeClippy will be hosted on Atom's package repository.

### Prerequisites

## Running tests

This section will eventually be updated with instructions for running CodeClippy's
